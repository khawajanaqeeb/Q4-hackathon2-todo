# Copy this file to Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables

# CRITICAL: Backend API URL - Replace with your Railway backend URL
# Example: https://your-backend-name.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend.railway.app

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT
# ====================================================================
#
# 1. Get your Railway backend URL:
#    - Go to Railway dashboard
#    - Find your backend service
#    - Copy the public URL (e.g., https://q4-hackathon2-todo-backend.railway.app)
#
# 2. Configure in Vercel:
#    - Go to: https://vercel.com/your-username/q4-hackathon2-todo-fullstack
#    - Click: Settings > Environment Variables
#    - Add variable:
#      Name:  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
#      Value: https://your-railway-backend.railway.app (your actual URL)
#      Environments: ✓ Production, ✓ Preview, ✓ Development
#
# 3. Redeploy:
#    - Go to Deployments tab
#    - Click "..." menu on latest deployment
#    - Click "Redeploy"

# TESTING THE FIX
# ====================================================================
#
# After setting the environment variable and redeploying:
#
# 1. Visit: https://q4-hackathon2-todo-fullstack.vercel.app
# 2. Try to register/login
# 3. Check browser DevTools > Console for errors
# 4. Network tab should show requests going to your Railway URL
#
# If you still see "Authentication service unavailable":
# - Verify Railway backend is running: curl https://your-backend.railway.app/health
# - Check Vercel build logs for environment variable warnings
# - Ensure CORS settings in backend allow your Vercel domain

## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive task list for fixing the Next.js memory crash in development mode, organizing tasks by user story with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created a detailed task breakdown with 6 phases, 32 individual tasks, and clear execution dependencies for the Next.js memory crash fix
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/phase-3/006-nextjs-memory-crash/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute the tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The tasks follow the SDD methodology and map directly to the user stories and requirements from the specification

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - the task breakdown was created successfully with all required sections
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all tasks organized by user story with proper format and dependencies
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard SDD task creation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with implementation phase to execute the tasks

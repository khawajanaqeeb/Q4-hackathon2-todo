## Prompt

Create a simple PHR for the frontend form accessibility specification

## Response snapshot

Created a PHR for the frontend form accessibility specification. The PHR follows the required format with appropriate metadata and placement in the general section of the prompt history. 

Frontend form accessibility is important for ensuring that web applications are usable by people with disabilities. This would typically involve considerations like proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, focus management, and semantic HTML structure.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR for frontend form accessibility topic
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for PHR creation
- 📁 Files: Created one PHR file in general section
- 🔁 Next prompts: Follow-up on specific accessibility requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Properly structured PHR with all required fields

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Define specific accessibility criteria for forms

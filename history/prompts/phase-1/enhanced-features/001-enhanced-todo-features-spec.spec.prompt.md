## Prompt

enhace the project phase1 with upgraded subagent hackathon-cli-builder to add these feautre specifically Add these bonus Intermediate features:
- Priorities (high/medium/low)
- Tags/Categories (multiple tags per task)
- Search tasks by keyword
- Filter by status, priority, tags
- Sort by priority, title, or ID
- Display tasks in a table with "Total Tasks: N" at the top
- Use rich library for beautiful tables (add to pyproject.toml via UV)

Keep all original Basic features.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Enhanced Phase I with the following:

**Feature Branch**: `002-enhanced-todo-features`

**7 Prioritized User Stories**:
1. P1 - Add Tasks with Priority and Tags
2. P1 - View Tasks in Beautiful Table Format
3. P2 - Search Tasks by Keyword
4. P2 - Filter Tasks by Criteria
5. P3 - Sort Tasks by Multiple Criteria
6. P3 - Update Tasks with New Features
7. P4 - Delete and Mark Complete with Enhanced Display

**45 Functional Requirements** (FR-001 through FR-045):
- Enhanced CRUD Operations (FR-001 to FR-006, FR-015)
- Priority Management (FR-019 to FR-022)
- Tags/Categories (FR-023 to FR-027)
- Search Functionality (FR-028 to FR-031)
- Filter Functionality (FR-032 to FR-036)
- Sort Functionality (FR-037 to FR-040)
- Display and UI (FR-041 to FR-045)
- Validation and Error Handling (FR-007 to FR-014)

**18 Success Criteria** (SC-001 through SC-018) covering:
- Basic operations enhanced (SC-001 to SC-005)
- Advanced features (SC-011 to SC-015)
- Performance and quality (SC-006 to SC-010)
- User experience (SC-016 to SC-018)

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- Three-layer architecture: models.py, services.py, cli.py
- Task dataclass with priority (Priority enum) and tags (list[str])
- Rich library for table display with graceful fallback
- In-memory storage with list of Task dataclasses

**12+ Edge Cases** documented with specific expected behaviors
**18 Assumptions** (A-001 through A-018) clearly documented
**7 Risks** (R-001, R-003, R-004, R-006 through R-010) with mitigation strategies

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive feature specification that extends Phase I with advanced todo management capabilities (priorities, tags, search, filter, sort) and professional rich library table display
- 🧪 Tests: Specification includes acceptance scenarios for all 7 user stories with Given-When-Then format
- 📁 Files: Created specs/002-enhanced-todo-features/spec.md and specs/002-enhanced-todo-features/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.clarify (optional for stakeholder review) or /sp.plan (create architectural plan)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully builds on Phase I while maintaining all original features. The upgrade hackathon-cli-builder agent capabilities are well-aligned with the spec requirements (dataclasses, three-layer architecture, rich library integration).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification is comprehensive and passes all quality checklist items
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All checklist items validated (Content Quality: 4/4, Requirement Completeness: 8/8, Feature Readiness: 4/4)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with /sp.plan to design three-layer architecture (models.py → services.py → cli.py) that will be generated by hackathon-cli-builder agent
